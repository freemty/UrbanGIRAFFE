This work presents UrbanGIRAFFE: Representing Urban Scenes as Compositional Generative Neural Feature Fields. We uses a coarse 3D panoptic prior, including the layout distribution of uncountable stuff and countable objects, to guide a 3D-aware generative model. Our model is compositional and controllable as it breaks down the scene into stuff, objects, and sky. Using stuff prior in the form of semantic voxel grids, we build a conditioned stuff generator that effectively incorporates the coarse semantic and geometry information. The object layout prior further allows us to learn an object generator from cluttered scenes. With proper loss functions, our approach facilitates photorealistic 3D-aware image synthesis with diverse controllability, including large camera movement, stuff editing, and object manipulation. We validate the effectiveness of our model on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the challenging KITTI-360 dataset.
